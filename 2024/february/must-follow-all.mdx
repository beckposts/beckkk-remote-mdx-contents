I'm writing this in folder bro.

Not so excited because I'll turn 24 this year and still wondering what I'm gonna do in my life.

> Yes, I did what I was supposed to. But I couldn't hold up on anything. Great year though "2023". Atleast I tried.

I was almost there. I was on progress. But it didn't last.

Inconsistency is the main reason I failed.

Yeah, that's it.

Consistency is all I need to change my whole dumb life.

## Journey

I entered into Stock market, earned money. 

Did my first long bike trip to Mandarmani & Digha.

Bought myself gadgets like Monitor, Home Theater, Mechanical Keyboard, Mouse and a digital writing pad with my own money.
