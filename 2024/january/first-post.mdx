When I decided that I'll journal my life from 2024 I had 2 choices.

    1. Journal with pen and paper on diary 
    2. Create something challenging for journaling, like a Digital Journal

And I chose option 2. 

I love programming and creating new stuffs with the help of computer and codes. So I created this.

This web app is totally created from scaratch by me.

## Why Journaling Digitally

Many studies have proved that writing helps in many ways. When I used to feel low, I would write my feelings on paper then burn.

I still write on diary but the problem with pen and paper on diary for me was different. 

Basically I wanted to organize my life in one place. Books I read in 2023 was very helpful but I can't even recall important quotes and notes which
is still highlighted with marker on books. And I did'nt wanted to open that book again. 

## What problem I'm solving with this

First things first, my journal will be with me every time, every where online. I can access it on any device.

I don't need to open books I read in past to reacall important notes because this journal will have a feature which
will show random highlighted notes which I marked on books everyday. (Still working on this feature)

Whatever I'll write I can see any time and with the help of getRandomPost() I would enjoy what I wrote on whatever day.

I'm very excited to write on the journal and hope this would help me in many ways.

There are many things to be done. Many features needs to be introduced. 

ðŸ‘‹See you beckkk in the next post.....
