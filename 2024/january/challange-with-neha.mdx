We dissuss a lot about money. We do not have very different opinion about this. 
And we do beleive that money cannot buy happiness, it can buy crazy ass happiness.

Ummmmm, whenever we go to the mall I don't why we like things which are expensive. I know expensive items
are of good in quality but shouldn't we see items through our pocket. 

So, this journal is all about the challenge between me & Neha.

She always says that she gonna earn more money than me. But with no ego, I'm gonna make more not because of
the challenge but because I always wanted to earn lot. So much that expensive items should look cheap ateast.

Anyway, challenge is challenge.

ðŸ‘‹ See You Ekka Neha. In Future.
