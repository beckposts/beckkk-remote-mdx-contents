I have been always curouis about the power. The power behind everything. And yes, I mean God.

I don't beleive in mircale stories. There is no magic around us. There is no good, bad or evil powers but there
are good and bad environments around us.

Recently I discoverd that I was subconsiosuly attracted to Philosophy. The questions what revolves around
my mind had been asked througout ages by anceient to mordern Philosophers. 

Where we came from? Why we are here? Who created us? 

These types of questions I used to ask my mother when I was kid. And she told me God created us.

I'm disclosing this here, deep down I never believed that there is God.

When I started reading other types of books I got to know that these types of question and answers already
came to my mind.

There is a pradox like this,
    If God created us and this universe who created God. If God created himself means there was something 
    before the existence of God.

But how can be there something before God.

So, I saw one bollywood movie, I don't remember the exact dialogs but I remember the context very well where 

The kid ask her mother - you are a scientist but why you pray to God.

Her mother repiled - I pray to the power. The power behind everything.

Something like that.

If I say there is God, I'm saying there is a power.

But If someone says there is God who has power, then how God created himself before the existence of power.

Really confusing. So I would like to be a better man in this world. And I don't care about the magic.
